it can b tough at times but just keep plodding - u will get there honestly ! U will have good and amp ; bad days - par for the course

keep going - we have all been through various periods of that - keep your chin up and drink wine smile -RRB-
he has been very throrough smile - which I can take positively as should lead to an improved thesis smile
I think every part of the process is more difficult and takes longer than you think - but each one is progress smile
thank you - and so can you ! ! ! smile
Have n't had too long to look at them - some need a bit of work doing , some are just typos or suggestions of wording smile

Though the weather here is hideous - you may want to bring your brolly - and your wellies !
Yes pop round here - I always have extra just in case smile And have a couple of bottles of red !
bah - I do n't think that matters smile -RRB-
No wine ? ? ? angry
ooh I am liking the look of that smile -RRB-
great - I thought so - and that is my normal approach smile -RRB-
probably why I do n't need the gadget smile -RRB-
I do not understand the concept of `` one glass '' - please explain smile
I tend to buy Chillean or South African white , sometimes Australian
lol - I am impressed by the gadgets smile -RRB-
in white , I like dry but with a fruity taste , so a nice sav blanc is good smile
I am thinking you are far too knowledgeable smile I just drink the stuff smile -RRB-
yes feel free to share you faves , I think the other 2 are red wine fans ; white for me smile
ooh sounds good - you 're definitely in if your parents have a wine cellar smile -RRB-

yay ! a new member of the phd wine club smile -RRB-
Great news Emma - will be starting in about an hour smile -RRB-

take no notice - we are very glad you live here smile -RRB- They are just ignorant ...
Glad he is ok Liz smile
yes although I am moaning -LRB- as it has n't improved -RRB- , it must be difficult to work in the heat ... but a bit of warmth would be lovely smile
MT my viva blog . and lt ; ------ I am sure will be interested in reading it smile
Have a great time ! smile
fab post ! smile Thanks for sharing smile
well it worked out fine for you in the end ! That is reassuring though ... as guess I will be in the same position smile
yes very true smile
yep - I only touch on it really - so was good to get a text which gives an overview of the concept ... smile
Good luck - I am sure youknow it so well anyway ...
Not read it all but the first bit is really good - explains key authors and concepts in an accessible way which I found very useful !
and not really reading all cover to cover - just dipping in to illustrate some points . .
but of course - constant supply of coffee helps - just was n't room in the photo smile
well done on still getting your work in then !
oh dear - hope you feel better soon !
How is the viva prep going ?
But yes on the positive - all over fairly soon ... only got 4 weeks till it needs to go to printing ...
I know but it is painful at times - dreading getting my full draft back in case far too many comments to address in time a\/v angry
those look familiar smile . This is my reading to help with my conclusions :
I think it has been there a little while but I only saw it switched on very recently - may have been earlier this week . .
Had yesterday off and updated two second tions in my conclusions . Having to go back to the books so very time consuming angry
very slowly . Just worked out how much time I have n't got till submission and slightly panicking ... Have fun in Brum smile
lol - at least it is supposed to be winter there smile -RRB- . How 's the new job going ?
I have just put my big jumper on and turned the gas fire on ! ! It just seems so wrong in June does n't it ?
What 's going on with the weather ? Wet , windy and I 'm freezing ! This is more like November angry
I think it is going to peak at 13 degrees here today angry Cold wet and windy forecast for the weekend angry
morning from a cool rainy 12 degrees angry
hope all goes ok smile
boo ! and yay ! smile -RRB-
smile
that must mean you are feeling a bit better now then ?
lol - not that we 're counting or nuffin smile -RRB-
Plus it is nearly wine night
Sounds like a good plan - and if yo enjoying it , that is half the battle smile
sounds like you are getting your mojo back smile -RRB- -RRB-
smile -RRB-
whereas I am freezing and just had to put my gas fire on - in JUNE ! ! ! !
thank you ! It is hard going at times - but hopefully worth it in the end ! smile -RRB-
I started mine in 2007 , and am p\/t - so it is about time I finished ! Aiming for submission end July , viva in October smile
yes definitely - just keep going and you will be there before youknow it smile -RRB- - although it wo n't feel like it now !
ha ha - looking forward to them smile Just think how giddy you will be if , I mean when you win ! ! smile -RRB- -RRB-
ooh good luck ! I will be looking out for the tweets smile -RRB-
well do n't overdo it if you are not well ! Take time to get better smile
yes we are never satisfied are we ? - I am moaning about it being cold and wet - you are not liking it hot ! smile -RRB-
fab - I have tea too - very necessary smile -RRB- Hope you have a productive day ! smile
Morning ! smile -RRB-
Morning ! Hope your dentist appt goes ok . Wish it was a bit warmer here - cool and rainy here in the UK angry
Morning all smile Off work today so it 's an EdD day today . Continuing to work on my conclusions today . Good luck to all working today !
fab ! smile
I take it you got things sorted out then ? smile -RRB-
I also have a private blog but that gets as neglected as my public one ! ; -RRB- -RRB-
yay ! smile -RRB-
nice one ! Well done smile -RRB-
if possible but not essential . Blogging could just help sort ideas out and could provide advice to others ?
process - so tips to others on lit review , interviewing , focus groups , transcribing , tools and tech that have helped you ,
yes I do agree - but I suppose different types of writing style perhaps ? I think it can help refine ideas though smile
Also blogging on the process can be really useful to others at a similar stage to you - I 've learned loads from other people 's blogs
and much easier - does n't put yourself out there too much to start with - as that can be daunting smile
yes-having said that I advise new phd students to start blogging and amp ; do n't often do so myself - so I 'm a bit of a hypocrite smile
I think those who have n't yet started blogging maybe start blogging about process rather then content until you gain confidence
interesting that she was encouraging you to then smile -LRB- Sort of do what I say not what I do smile -RRB-
yes I think I would have had more time early on - so wish I had blogged more then !
yes agree smile -RRB-
yep agreed - I think it would be beneficial but all spare time goes to progressing thesis
yep - and does n't go away as you feel like a complete novice at every new stage of the process smile -RRB-
I wish my sup had encouraged me to do so - I think I would have been more likely to do so and seen the benefit smile
mine is a combination of time -LRB- fitting it in round other stuff especially when p\/t -RRB- and lack of confidence
me too - nearing the end of my journey and really wished I 'd had the confidence to blog more smile
we can invent our own methodology - something wine related smile -RRB-
pick me ! pick me ! ! ! !
ooh Crete sounds fab ? do you need any other researchers to help ? smile -RRB- -RRB- -RRB-
Well done England ! ! Top of the group smile -RRB-
well all the best with it smile
yep and often these things lead to others - once you get known . Well done smile -RRB-
I bet - is it a permanent job ?
Getting organised for the England match . Come on England ! ! ! ! smile -RRB-
Fantastic ! ! Well done ! ! smile -RRB-
No I do n't think we have met although we may have been at a conference at the same time in the past . . smile
the main thing is that you understand how to progress . Seek clarification if you need it . Good luck smile
How do you feel ? - do you feel you understand what you need to do ?
Hope it goes well !
Very proud of all the VLA Support Assistants who have just presented to the Pro-VC , and did an excellent job . Well done all !
totally agree - otherwise you feel you are the only one and therefore not up to it smile -RRB-
fabulous ! ! smile
ooh happy 40th for last Weds smile I hope you celebrated ! smile -RRB-
Happy Birthday ! smile
my first reaction was - am I kidding myself that I can actually do this ? Your post made me feel more normal smile -RRB- -RRB- Thanks !
Really liked your blog post and amp ; it resonates with me . I 've just had one ch back from sup with loads of comments to address
Fab !

yep - it has finished now 3-2 to England smile -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB-
Well done England ! ! Was very stressful to watch , particularly the last 10 mins but we got the right result !
Not finished yet - it is 2-2 smile
That 's more like it England ! ! Come on ! !

Nice one - well done smile -RRB-
smile -RRB-

We have a leaky radiator and a faulty boiler - they were supposed to come out yesterday and rang up to cancel
Love the power of social media - has worked really well before smile -RRB- Thanks for suggestion smile
yes that it why I put it in a tweet - it has worked before with other companies - they pick up the tweet via a bot smile
Thanks smile - they are not our supplier but we have the maintenance contract with them - one of our radiators is leaking angry
British Gas are completely rubbish - they have canceled 3 appointments now in 2 days , all last minuted and amp ; have n't called us back as promised

Had lots of family round for lunch today to celebrate Lauren 's 11th birthday which is tomorrow . Absolutely shattered now ...
Did n't get much work done this weekend due to daughter 's birthday but just sent a full draft of my thesis to my supervisor smile
Shattered after having my family around for daughter 's birthday . There were a lot of kids running round the place smile
fantastic smile
Cheers Emma . Hope you are feeling a bit better smile
thanks - and I will try not to smile Hope yours is going ok smile
it is - but I still worry about it not being good enough smile
yes - although I could have done with spending time on it as a full draft due into my supervisor on Monday ! smile How 's yours going ?
Phew - just taken 7 10\/11 year olds to laserquest and then had them back here for pizza and games . They have now left . Where 's the wine ? smile
lol - I certainly hope so smile -RRB-
I am just doing a buffet lunch as do n't have enough space for everyone to sit down at the table ... easy stuff smile -RRB-
and about 12 of my family coming over for lunch tomorrow - so house and food prep really needed !
Not much chance of me doing any phd work . Daughter 's birthday so we have laser quest with six of her friends today
Try and enjoy your phd-free weekend and hope you recover soon !
Happy Birthday ! smile -RRB-
I am sure she will be made to feel very special . And probably a good thing that she wo n't fully understand what is going on .
So sorry to hear that angry . Our thoughts are with your family .

I really ca n't imagine ! ! ! Hoping to find out sometme in the near future though ! Good luck with yours smile
Enjoy your bath Emma - hope you are feeling a bit better tomorrow smile
Good idea . I do smaller jobs and editing in the evenings - and keep the more difficult stuff for weekends\/days off
Make a list of small tasks like references to check , things to look up etc and do those whenever you have a spare half-hour or so
ooh not there yet - submitting July , viva probably October smile You are right about the bits of time ...
No neither could I - but have been going since 2007 smile It will come round if you just keep going - honest !
thanks - very excited at the thought of submitting smile
thanks - nearly there but still a way to go smile Started in 2007 - so about time smile -RRB-
dare n't even say that at this stage smile . Probably viva in October so with any luck may be done and dusted by the end of the year smile
absolutely my 3 -RRB- would be that - to drink wine on a weekend night and enjoy life at least occasionally smile
thanks - we are having a ft\/pt debate on tonight . Am nearing the end as aim to submit by end July this year smile -RRB-
yeah sorry forgot to add to my first two tweets tonight so resent with it on smile
smile -RRB-
thanks smile -RRB-
smile -RRB-
My two mantras for p\/t phd work are 1 -RRB- just keep plodding - you have to get there eventually and 2 -RRB- do at least something every day
there you go - you have done something productive today - celebrate that !
exactly - crap TV and wine on Fri\/Sat nights keep me going the rest of the week smile
twitter is a distraction and aid at the same time . Always good to know others are phd-ing too smile
yes and I still find time for crap TV smile -RRB-
that must be tough - having a small baby\/child - at least mine are a bit older smile
it is tough going sometime - good time consuming and not much social life smile -RRB-
yep - doing both and have 3 kids smile -RRB- Tough going sometimes smile
totally agree - full time job , part time phd , and 3 kids = no spare time whatsoever smile -RRB-
I work f\/t , phd p\/t I think adv of doing p\/t phd is that it gives it perspective - does n't completely take over your life
the disadvantage of doing p\/t phd is that you need to spend months t of your weekends and evenings on your phd work
the disadvantage of doing p\/t phd is that you need to spend months t of your weekends and evenings on your phd work
I work f\/t do phd p\/t . I think advantage of doing p\/t phd is that it gives it perspective - does n't completely take over your life
I have n't heard of it too - hope you are ok smile
thank you and yes it does smile Hope yours goes well too - ca n't wait till it is all over ...
- good luck ! I am aiming to submit fully by end of July smile
oh just invited you via work email - dm \/ email your hotmail one so I can try that . I think it should then just appear in your dropbox
is your dropbox associated to your work email address ? I will try sharing it again .
you should n't be downloading and uploading - just editing directly - you have n't had trouble before . May be ask Andy as he has access
Did you tell that we have a new comp going and we started last week ? smile
your scores are not in the new spreadsheet - I have just added mine and Andy has done his ...
I am not that athletic ! smile
thanks - hope you are feeling better soon . Enjoy daytime TV smile -RRB-
The kids play wii tennis sitting down , I play like I am on court jumping round putting lots of energy in . They still win angry
Off work all week for half-term . Done my real exercise , now playing wii tennis with 2 of my kids
I will email you my excel chart and then we can meet for coffee when I am back in -LRB- with c 11th June -RRB- to discuss a plan of action smile
happy to share these or discuss if of any help .
I did an excel spreadsheet to plan overall EdD stages in a gantt chart , then had 6 monthly big targets and weekly to-do lists smile
Have n't got there yet smile However if you need any help or advice I would be more than happy to oblige smile
great post smile . And if I can manage to continue to work towards an EdD with working and 3 kids - you can too smile
I still do n't see a link smile -RRB-

I know how you feel , and I am exactly the same but sometimes you have to accept it is just out of your control smile
poor you - sounds very nasty - look after yourself !
Happy Anniversary ! ! smile -RRB-
thanks - I am managing to cut down but by not nearly enough ! angry It is hard going - hope you do ok smile
Using the bank holiday to do some more editing and trying to cut words out of my thesis
congrats - to them and you ! smile
sounds rough - hope you are ok xx
well that is still good - and lovely you have got that option - you can go whenever the weather is decent smile -RRB-
thanks smile - are you going anywhere in the summer ?
it is very likely that is the last hol that my eldest daughter will be coming on - possibly my son too who turns 18 in Sept. . angry
I know - very excited at the though of having submitted ! We 're going for 3 weeks too - yay ! Not had a holiday all year though .
Me too ! We are going to Florida in August smile Will be extremely hot ! !
really ? Apparently I looked exactly like the younger one when I was her age ...
they bought the matching playsuits to wear when we go on holiday in August ... smile
ha ha - I do n't think I quite have the figure for a playsuit , no to mention it would embarrass my daughters smile
ooh that looks lovely ! smile
they will - they have bought them specially smile - yes got a couple of tops for my hols too smile Nothing matching tho ! ; -RRB-
smile - they both got them too - so they could be twins on holiday in August smile -RRB-
Holiday clothes shopping smile
I know - I ca n't normally take advantage as 10 yo normally up at 7.30-ish at weekends . Love it smile -RRB-
ooh dear ! Hope they are all ok today ! Yes enjoying the peace whilst it lasts - older two teenagers not surfaced yet ! smile -RRB-
how did the sleepover go ? I am getting a bit of editing done before my 10 yo returns from her lack-of-sleep over smile -RRB-
Happy Birthday ! ! smile
100 % agree smile
totally agree - loved it . I wanted Tyler to win but great performance by Leanne .
yep - fab was n't it ! Watched on delay TV but that was clearly my best performance of the night
yay - glad u are feeling well enough 2 drink wine . I ca n't start yet as driving soon but will as soon as I can
good - that must mean you are feeling a bit better at least ! smile
I have to pick up my hubby from the station later , he has been abroad , and then it is the voice final and wine I think smile -RRB-
ooh you are brave ! I have just dropped off my 10 year old daughter at a sleepover in a caravan - doubt if much sleep will go on
good plan !
smile -RRB-
yes I know - I also have a 19 year-old daugher smile -RRB-
lol - but trying to complete a phd with 3 kids and working full time is not that easy . . smile
you must enjoy it to be volunteering to do a lit review so soon after completing your phd ! smile
transcription is very slow - but useful and all part of the process . It took me ages but well worth it smile
I am not doing much today - as kids around and hubby abroad - but if I do get any time , I am editing today ! Keep going ! smile
My 10 year old daughter also does n't like shopping - I imagine that will change soon but have to drag her out smile -RRB-
we 'll see - I am not good shopping for stuff for me when with others - I prefer to be on my own smile
thanks . I think a shopping trip is on the cards in terms of entertainment smile
Good luck ! I will be editing if poss but unlikely to get much done as hubby abroad , so kids to entertain smile
oh no - that is not good ! Hope you improve soon xx
it would me too ! Just . take it easy and have some wine . smile
you see - doctor 's orders . You have to do it ! \* cheers \*
really ? That 's terrible . Make sure you get enough rest and do n't push it . You can catch up when feeling well again .
oh poor you - hope you recover soon . May be a small glass of wine would perk you up AND help you sleep smile
how have we got to this time on a Friday with no mention of Just about to indulge smile How are you Emma ?
me too ! So far i have gone food shopping and taken my daughter clothes shopping !
