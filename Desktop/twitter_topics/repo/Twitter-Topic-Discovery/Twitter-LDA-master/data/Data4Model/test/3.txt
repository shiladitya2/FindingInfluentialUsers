Should try a few Kimi Raikkonen interviews .
He 's quite chirpy for a Scot .
I do n't think so but I could be wrong .
Different ball problems tonight .
I think it was a 2 hour sleep that night . I feel too old for that now .
Great fun for early start . Wish I could be there .
\* laughing \*
I saw someone describe it as angry bees in a tin !
Do not budgie sit on race weekends !
We 'd have more Scottish winners if they did that .
A tenner says it 's health and safety .
I 've never personally been aware of that being a particularly sweaty region , personally . But then I do n't play pro tennis !
Husband watching tennis only to lipread Andy Murray . Apparently he said : `` Gie 's a towel , ah 'm sweating ma c \* nt aff . '' Oh my !
Oh no ! Serious bad luck angry What happened ? Can you say ?
Hmmm , not an unappealing thought , I find .
The entire GP or just your trip to it ?
Oh do n't , I can barely begin to dare imagining . So badly want to the first Brit winner in donkeys to be a Scot !
It 's OK , I got a spare one , you can have him . They are everywhere , here . Two-a-eurocent .
Hehehe smile I just want Roddick and Ferrer to finish so Murray can get on court . Neglected kids again !
Quite amazing how much youknow about this . Quite amazing . grin
Murray is always having a hoik of his danglies , too . Makes me wonder if he 's too well hung for tennis playful
To clean your spare room ?
Plenty of time to keep working through your bucket list .
My grandfather died at 76 . You might , too .
Oh same . She made me wish for red hair .
Then Iona eviction ?
Well you can guarantee rain now , Wimbledon and British GP . Then Olympics . Wet all summer .
I have all that ahead of me . Ca n't say I await it joyously !
hope
Sounds like a great day , how the weather is kind .
welcome home , glad you made it safely . Sleepy weekend ahead ?
Love it . Might teach it to the kids tomorrow !
Perry whatsisname . Teen friend of Kathy Burke who co wrote it with Harry Enfield .
Do youknow the background to the sketch . Characters based on real teens ... One being the guy who plays Billy Mitchell , E\/enders .
yes ... perfect chance to get steamboats . Will she be joining in ?
sounds lovely ... except for the spare room bit .
Jobs are a pain sometimes , tally ho into the weekend . Are you packed out with fun things to do ?
Any special occasion ?
glug glug bonk
Maternal advice pls : 5yo -LRB- who never complains -RRB- says foot is sore to put weight on . She \* can \* bear weight , but if preferring not to . Ideas ?
Only for some women , though ... and you never know where you are in that lottery . Bit jealous ... always liked swarthy little French
Yes , I read it today . Explains why she looked so washed out around election time . Not easy , a tiny one and pregnant at 44 .
Why do the Daily Mail not pick on James and his overdue beer baby ?
... resulting in the best present ever of course .
Thanks . Not going to wish you a good weekend . I am going to wish a hard labor for you ! -LRB- rrwell not really hard , obv . -RRB- xx
Very pretty .
Your carriage has arrived ...
Every now and then a strong whiff of shit passes my nose . Do n't know if it 's me , the kids , the cat or coming from outside .
Who said that it bothers me ?
Oh my , Mme Sarkozy is expecting another .
Well bugger me ! The sun just came out . And it 's suddenly glorious . I love living in The Netherlands .
Wow could be going on my list of favorite players . Something irresistible about his pace . Reminds me of the Hurricane at the table .
Thank you , too smile I hope today is going well for you .
Really ? I thought it might be Katie 's clothing allowance ?
Am months t grateful to the rain in London for affording me the chance to watch the last bit of Nadal v Rosol last night .
Ew headache angry Hope it clears soon and you can rock Friday eventually .
I will have to look out for them . Skint at the moment or would order one . Kids will nick it of course inamused
I think I was reading about this , just this week . Thought not available outside USA yet ? Is it on pre-order ? Fancy one , too .
Does anyone get good results with ? I find it horrendous . Ripped off loads , never get paid , jobs do n't match description etc
Is this the one that is meant to be blowing the arse off the iPad for a fraction of the price ?
Good morning Alan .
Yes it does rather get in the way of loafing , I imagine . But busy is good . Good to hear from you .
I really want one of these , medicinal wine purposes only of course -
Pleased to hear it . Busy ? Not heard you about much lately ?
As long as you have more mayo than frites you will be going the right direction . Belgian GP put me off waffles for life !
I made a new friend on Twitter this week . Thank you - prettig weekend xx
Borrow ? The tight fuckers !
and support her in erasing the stigma around mental illness , depression and suicide in Ireland and the world .
Do n't forget to have mayo with fries smile
Presumably executive level to qualify for free brolly , therefore silently counting his bonus to repel stares grin
my oldest , dearest motorsporting and general life buddies : - I hope you are all well .
Is he getting pelters ?
rrwell how annoying that I went to bed during the roof-closing break last night .
rrwell how annoying that I went to bed during the roof-closing break last night .
rain ... 30 min break while roof is closed .

Earwigging on kids ' Minecraft chat . Apparently , 5yo used to call the villagers `` cottagers '' . Erk !
Children are starving here while I watch tennis
It 's a nail-biter .
Are you watching the tennis ?
Turning 95 % of my attention to supporting - the rest will be used trying to keep the kids off Minecraft .
One of my faves ... \* searching youtube \*
How right your good lady wife was . I 'd be inclined to add , nor sounds good !
So ... motor racing turns drivers into old ladies smile
The 8yo would do the same but she would get caught doing it . Little one has a bit of nous about her !
She even has that trick of poking one knuckle higher than the others for a proper dig .
Might just add that 5yo daughter should probably be renamed Bruno . She 's well ` ard . Knows how to punch properly , though never been taught !
5yo daughter : `` Collin always fights and hits me . '' ME : `` What do you do ? '' HER : `` I just punch his face in . ''
That 's like the thunder we get here . I keep looking up for low-flying 747s .
Wow that is al months t worth having a baby for smile
Katie was an utter little madam long before she ever made an appearance . Still as stubborn and obstinate now .
Stand as much as you can so gravity pulls her down . Oooh she is just like you playful
May I suggest , again , nipple \* exercises \* . Get the oxytocin flowing . It 's what they give you in hosp to induce . Make your own !
Also , please do reassure me that you will be live-tweeting every contraction . Hehe .
I am on edge dearest , do hurry up and put us out of our misery grin
Hmm ... no updates or tweets from my heavily pregnant friend for some time ... is Iona on her way ? How are you doing
It is called Costa Del Zeumeren which made me giggle . We have so much more exploring to do . Recommend to me anything you love !
Not the beach so much as the sea air . Lots of gorgeous places here to make up for it . Absolutely love it the lake beach near us !
FB friend recently commented on her toddler calling ppl fat . My kids do n't even know what that means !
I agree , never judge person on appearance , but I am 3 stone too heavy for my health . Losing some would do me good .
except the skinny ... Sadly I am not getting that !
oh dear that sounds familiar . I 'm on valdoxan and seroquel and have the same situation .
LOL smile I might have to unfollow you if you continue to put me to such intellectual shame ; -RRB-
Messing with the blog 's clothes again . This is my current preferred method of procrastination .
The problem with following lots of genuinely witty , talented , funny , insightful , brilliant people is how much more shit it makes me .
We lived very close to the beach in Ireland but never got as much sand in the house as we do here ! My youngest fills her shoes up .
I refused my youngest 's request to commandeer the PC . She 's now playing `` Minecraft '' with her cuddly toys , digging up the sofa .
Successfully brainwashing my eldest into loving brie
Oops , perhaps their site ca n't cope with a Fry retweet inamused
In a Scots accent : What do you do if you find a trumpet growing in your garden ? Root it oot .
Some poor junior IT guy on 11k a year gets blame for bank meltdown last week . Typical ! Systems should ensure it ca n't happen !
Hard to look thin standing next to - he vanishes when he turns side on .
and they will still be right .
Big Ben is the name of the bell . Most people do n't know the tower 's name .
Left upstairs windows open ... Kids ' room will have more sand than a speeltuin .
Sadly , no. . On the plus side , the street sweeper also sucked up the weeds . Bonus .
Murray is playing his grandpa .
oh no that is horrendous . Awful for you .
Chicken and rice , ever-so-nice , a few green veggies but no potato wedgies , fry and boil , do n't let it spoil , munch munch , tasty lunch . -LRB- tea -RRB-
I suppose I am a bit unfair , after all , my employer was such a wonderful company to work for . Shame it killed itself ; -RRB-
Apart from that , the Ice-cream was lovely grin
Was quite happy to rob us when he thought we were Polish or some other such disliked `` blow-in '' .
Did I tell you about the one who , when he heard Pete 's accent , cut 1 off total saying : `` Oh I could n't rob a Scotsman . ''
You know I did ; -RRB-
If you have n't seen this yet , it might make you smile ...
`` Tinkle tinkle tinkle . '' The Dutch ice-cream van cometh . Far better than the blaring `` Yankee Doodle '' we had in Ireland .
No it is , quite oddly for the DM , quite factual . Maccydees are one of the main sponsors . Oh the irony !
`` Doodleydo-do-dooo ... Error , please move Roomba to a new location ''
Yes , I also find it very tiring and stressful to clean out the muck bin every day .
Both children have gone to play at friends ' houses . I love how welcoming and friendly our Dutch neighbors are . No clique-crap here !
I love having a Roomba . I 'm working \* cough cough \* while it cleans .
I 've just changed my blog 's clothes . That template was nice but lacking post format options .
OMG the street sweeper is outside . Ca n't see a thing - it resembles a desert storm out there ! Thanks for the dirty windows !
Has anyone got 499 spare for ? Or does Bernie still close down non-licensed sites ?
It gets better smile
Could n't imagine life without ... -
Euroshopper cherry jam is very nice .
I bet that is where the change break originated way back when paying taxes was cool .
Do you feel strong enough for a mission ? Even only some days ? It 's good to have purpose .
I imagine the BBC scheduling team are delighted England are out of the footy .
Am reading this .
Ouch that must really hurt angry I 'm so sorry to hear this .
It must be difficult to cope with . I hope you can go home soon .
Did you hear the one about the girl called - she 's top story at the Daily Mail right now ! Chortle !
I imagine your loony bins are a lot nicer , too , but I do n't have first hand experience -LRB- came close , though . -RRB-
I definitely do NOT recommend moving to Ireland . It 's going to hell in a handbasket ... fast . grin
Here , there are lots called `` Draadloos '' . We thought it must be some witty thing but no , it is Dutch for `` Wireless '' !
It 's an amazing adventure , are all having so much fun exploring . Husband lived here before and been trying to move back for years !
And toddlers and their parents ... remember that phase of poop obsession ? My youngest still in it -LRB- age 5 -RRB- .
Thank you smile I am still in that culture-shock-amazement phase . Everything is `` wow '' and `` look '' and `` OMG '' and I am LOVING it ...
Got to go to shops before school ends ... hugs , try to stay calm , know it 's hard . It will all work out ok . Til later sis . anger
Not easy to bear at your stage -LRB- nesting etc -RRB- . Definitely need clean place for sterilising . -LRB- Glad I used boobs - lazy ! -RRB-
You should put the rent up grin
Ah , not really worth killing him over then . Remember your hormones ! I lost it over clothes pegs when Katie was born grin
You must have a set of stairs you could innocently push him down ?
What 's happened ?
Life in Nederland -
It 's not even THE torch ... be better to take hold of the very one that every one before you carried .
I have n't watched any of it ... any I have caught was overweight people trying their best to run or famous non sports folk . WTF ?
I 'm very shocked by it . What harm could she have done ? Bent double with osteoporosis or something . She deserves an apology .
Does anyone else agree that shoving this old lady like this is too rough , unnecessary and nasty .
That 's a bit bloody much , clearly an old lady . Too rough . Shame .
Oh so you still click through for a nosey over the profile . teehee
I hate the thought Facebook is suggesting me to people I would n't piss on if they were burning .
Good luck anger
Ik ook smile I always wanted to be fluent in a 2nd language but Dutch people speak such good English it 's too easy to not speak Dutch !
No , we moved here in January . I intend to learn though . The children are at normal Dutch school and learning lots .
You should see what it does with letters from school . I am always getting into trouble for not understanding
Oh I know ... but I lack any other way to do it . It does cause lots of amusing moments smile
However it does translate the Dutch word for products to `` messages '' . Which is cute , as that 's what us Scots call our shopping .
Online shopping in Dutch - Google translate fail . Feminine Shaving products translated as `` shaved wife . ''
Time to go shopping . Online supermarket that is .
Bloody Maldonado
Has anyone ever won a staring contest with Kimi Raikkonen ?
disappointed ... Thought it might be Eddie .
They have patiently waited for the flag already . I would not answer .
fernando nearly missed it , too .
I am too old to entertain the thoughts I have about Alonso .
aye , fools seldom differ ... Hehe
Benevolence will probably only last until I actually see his smugness up there .
haha I did n't see this before I tweeted the same . On stupid phone app ca n't edit rt .
brilliant .
Quite nice to see MSC get podium .
Lovely to see Alonso getting a flag .
Fuck . Nerfed off for sure .
Quite glad hates HAM , she was always a fucking jynx for poor grin
Who stole the real Valencia ? ? ?
Totally agree .
Remember the days when McLaren pitstops were formidable ? Seems a long time ago now .
My BBC signal is going off and on . Very annoying . Reverted to illegal Sky stream online .
she was just telling you to slow down , strong , fighter like her mam .
be surprised if she waits much longer ... My money was on tomorrow , too .
good sign
Roast chicken and grands prix . Bliss .
Nice !
Chicken roasting smells wafting around the room . F1 build-up on TV
I agree is a natural in that role . Enjoy the race smile
Katie addicted to her first ever Harry Potter book . New today .
Today is a very special day . I bought my 8yo her first Harry Potter book . She 's not lifted her nose out of it once !
Middle of the city ... Windmill . I love Utrecht .
Glad it was n't a pet snake !
not really a surprise .
black bull in edinburgh ... Drunk and disorderly hehe
haha oh yeah that sounds like triple trouble , can understand the `` get ready '' time now .

definitely agree , men far worse in my experience .
fuck the Daily Mail . Filthy rag .
Happy birthday mama . Love you anger

free wifi at mcdonalds ?
5yo just said : `` look how fast I can horse . '' Before trotting up the kitchen at a pace .
we 're doing the maccy dee too . paydaytreat

Ha I did wonder as it 's the sort of thing my 2 addicts would day , too ! Ages 5 and 8 .
I 've run out of tablets and on a little trip with myself .
does 6yo play Minecraft ? I think he\/she would enjoy it . lots of lava and making things with diamonds .
welcome back

me and school trips did n't mix well .

I fainted in a French department store ... Woke up to lots of faces and French voices . confused
Kids want the computer . Think I will have a slosh in a hot bath while they are at it .
Me too . Illegally . grin
You will go into labor in the middle of the night smile
And if I leave my kids alone with their Dad for any length of time I come home to find all they have eaten is sweeties !
Oh jesus some men ! -LRB- My adoptive father was the same , we could n't be left alone with him at all ! -RRB-
He could listen to a baby monitor for a few hours surely ?
And you have so much help this time around with big brother , Daddy , your dad on hand ... Will be a joyous time for you all .
Other mothers are the worst . Competitive parenting not my scene at all .
They make you feel guilty for every decision then wonder why so many people get post natal depression !
It 's disgusting to pressure mothers into something they are not comfortable with . These people should know better .
And you have successfully mothered one child al months t to adulthood , so you can always chuck that in their faces smile
Yep . Sadly , motherhood is all about guilt and other people 's opinions . The looks I got for ignoring Katie 's tantrums in shops !
You wo n't get those from me . Happy mummy = happy baby .
First Rule of Twitter ... Do n't Twitter While At Work ! -LRB- Unless it 's lunch hour -RRB-
Yes , they will get sore , see it as toughening them up for that hungry little mouth -LRB- if you go down that route -RRB- .
That too , quite possible
rrwell not him specifically but the accent . Much as I love him and all that ; -RRB-
When sees this conversation his ego is going to expand grin
It was only living in the south that I discovered the female equivalent is `` yerwan ''
Aaaw . NI accents still have that affect on me , too .
The 5-y-o sitting on my knee playing her DS . Just gave herself a big fright and jumped two inches off my knee .
NIPPLES !
That is my friend 's mother , not Jim Clark 's grin
Random F1 fact : One of my best childhood friends is a nephew of the great Jim Clark . And his mother had dinner with Jean Todt circa 1971 !
I am illegally watching Sky F1 . Do n't tell them , will you .
Haaaaaaaaaaaaahahaha . grin Loving your workas always Doc .
And I am female .
I 'm Scottish . smile
Big Ben is the name of the bell , not the tower smile

I do hope is going to live Tweet her labor and delivery .
I 'd feel let down if I went to a DD gig and was wearing smoking jacket , cravat etc !
Makes you wonder if they score extra points for customer irritation smile
I 'd like to see how many journalists are still at the top of their game after 30 + years . still rocks .
Hate the - now they 're having a pop at for doing what he does so well - entertaining people .
And of cousre they ca n't sell you a part-month or apply any rational\/logical thinking or indeed do anything useful .
jys , keke and ?
Not saying much today ... too `` up '' to sit at the PC for long . Husband says he 's confiscating my tablets next time house needs cleaning smile
Accidentally put 8-y-o 's T-Shirt in hot wash with towels . Fortunately , it now fits the 5-y-o perfectly .
This reminds me of your drinking ability ...
Aw smile B2 was the first show I was allowed to stay up and watch `` after the news '' -LRB- and after all else in bed -RRB-
Aah looking at wrong bit . 83 for series 1 and 86 for series 2 . I never saw 1 until years later .
Wow , B2 originally aired 1983 it says . Ca n't be right , sure it was brand new when I was watching it as a teen .
Well I was about 15 or so for B2 ... 86\/87 ish ? Googling ...
You were just a wee tot when it was first on TV I suppose .
Kidding me Elaine ! You 've not seen ALL of Bl ` adder 2 so many times you can recite it backwards ?
It 's never too late for Blackadder chat !
And later when Baldrick lights the fire with it . I do n't know why but it just hits the chuckle spot with me .
Love Robbie Coltrane . Saw Rowan wipe out in a DB8 -LRB- I think -RRB- at Croft one time . He looked very unhappy .
2nd favorite Bl ` adder episode : -LRB- `` I 'm a slow reader myself '' . -RRB-
-LRB- Probably my all time favorite Bl ` adder episode -RRB-
LMAO . Where have n't I been ? -LRB- I thought it was a Flash reference ! -RRB-

Steady on , it was n't as good as my football one last night .
Ha ha love it . '' Breaking . Cameron and amp ; Osborne launch rival social network to It 's upperclasstwitter ''
Is that a flag in your pocket or ... ?
Hi Monica . Not sure if I tweeted already . Network proble Ms Sorry you 're in hosp so long . Be well soon . Tot straks .
chuckle
Feet up then , take it easy . Although I know at this stage there 's no getting comfortable inamused
Second time to apologise ? That 's me grin
Amusing imagining the meeting : `` Who 's going to ask Sinead ? '' ... `` Oh go on Colm , you do it , she likes you ... '' Teeheehee .
Sorry my typing skills have run away with the faeries now . Migraine thing going on . Ack .
So they got Colm to ask youknow you 'd likely turn down an official govt event ? He should have said no. . Weak .
OMG for real ? Gagged by your own govt ? Colm should have known better , has dragged Amnesty into because of his position .
Oh my god will this bloody headache ever just do one . I am sick of putting up with it now .
Bloody sore head ... woke up with it and nothing is shifting it . Thanks for asking . Hope you 're feeling good .
Phew - waterpokken is Dutch for chickenpox ! Kids have both had that already smile
Trying to google translate a letter from school . It 's a warning about an illness going around ! Waterpokken ! WTF ?
Oh jeez that is so tragic , poor boy .
I really hope Alan will take action . I trust in your faith in him .
Looks like Shatter only used his Twitter to get elected . Too busy filling his pockets with taxpayers cash now I bet .
Prove that you meant those words I just retweeted . Save Ireland 's Suicidal . ACT NOW . People are dying .
Hi Dylan . Stay strong and be proud . Its our intelligence that messes up our brains . Ever need a chat , tweet me . xx
You know what I have n't heard for ages ? Radio GaGa . Long Live Queen -LRB- miss you Freddie -RRB-
Jeezo you 've been so quite I thought you must be pushing by no. . Just a shopping trolley though by sounds of it grin
Sadle has n't tweeted since February 2011 . Hope he gets email notifications .
. PLEASE help erase the stigma of mental health in Ireland . People are dying .
I suspect I may not be affecting the trend , in the Netherlands as I am .
Ireland 's govt M USA T focus on anti-suicide campaigns , more die from suicide than road accidents . PLEASE RT
How long will it be before he mysteriously dies in strange circumstances and is denied a coroner 's inquest ?
That news has made me happy . Free Julian
Do fuck off
My Irish family were supportive and understanding , but they warned me not to tell anyone I was `` mental '' STIGMA M USA T END
Fuck sake that is EXACTLY what my `` friend '' said -LRB- -RRB-
please re tweet . . Ireland 's suicidal people need help . All mentally ill people deserve maximum respect at all times
I 'm afraid that is the absolute truth .
We do n't say `` spastics '' or `` mongols '' now . They are pejorative ter Ms They hurt sufferers . So do `` Mental '' `` Crazy '' `` Loony '' etc
In my experience , mental health care and provision in Ireland is excellent . MORE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THEY CAN GET HELP .
I 've a friend in second ure mental health care who says I could probably still sue NHS over that . Not got the strength for it .
. I thank you too . Listened to it this morning online . Please help Ireland 's people to LIVE !
Dear Sinead ...
I want to write you a letter . I think I will put it on my blog and let youknow when it is ready ? That ok with you ?
BWahahahahahah ! -LRB- -RRB-
I find dandruff shampoo is all crap anyway , nothing shakes my flakes ! Or my flakey brain grin
Listening to speaking on radio last night . -LRB- starts ar 16.44 -RRB- .
Yay well done your boy ! My kids pick other people 's litter up `` tut-tutting '' as they go !
See comment from mike smith , guantanamo bay , 20/6/2012 07:21 -LRB- it made me smile and nod . -RRB-
Aiming for horizontalism - might persuade my overactive mind it 's bedtime .
Raising the whale LOL . I remember the feeling . Not for much longer now . anger
Do n't drop the phone ! Not too hot mind , ca n't have her coming before the 25th !
I 'm just getting the Twitter commentary . -LRB- Pete is ... and I am sitting by the TV but that is beside the point ! -RRB-
Ahem ... AS IF !
Do they get dive through penalties ?
Perfect analogy .
My youngest just said : `` Mummy , did youknow that the Dutch for `` puter '' is `` COMputer . '' Maybe should have corrected that baby word before now !
What the fuck happened to `` Educate Together '' eh O'Gorman you weak-spined man . Be different if it was gay rights I suppose .
Absolutely shocked and disgusted that O'Gorman has n't the balls to do the right thing .
To them maybe . But what about to you ? It might help you AND lots of other sufferers and bring about debate !
BTW is pinching the seat of the person who gets up to make a brew for the whole room smile
You made me make myself a cup . Like yawning - uncontrollable reaction smile
Did you sneak out and make a brew without offering ?
rrwell sadly I 've never met you , so youknow better than I. But , us BP folks are not always best judge of ourselves smile
My sweet little baby has fallen fast asleep on my knee . She 's 5 lol .
Hi Kathleen , following you now , nice to \* meet \* you . I 'm in Netherlands - we 're al months t neighbors hehe .
You 're such a good person .
Someone tell me to get off Twitter . This upswing is fun so far but when I crash I will be deleting tweets and blog posts in disgust at self .
As you said yesterday , mental = intelligence . Does anyone call Bonzo mental when he lets a sweary slip out ? Thought not .
Bunch of hypocrites then , I never heard more swearing than when I lived in Ireland -LRB- saying something for a Scot too -RRB-
Hopefully only the left side at this stage . And never lie on your back -LRB- if you 're like me that will be too sore now anyway -RRB-
You SO have to get a photograph of that LMAO . Hope she does n't steal it for her bed . -LRB- Sure Brian would love it ! -RRB-
I do n't think you do darling . Not by general Irish standards -LRB- and Scottish , like me -RRB- anyway . Be yourself , love you that way
Pisses me off that people are so fucking snotty-nosed about swearing . They are only words FFS .
BTW that hanging thing has ties at the bottom so you can second ure it to cot sides -LRB- or whatever suits -RRB- . Safe for baby -LRB- IKEA -RRB- .
Thanks for playing this James track . Love it and not heard it for so long .
Sounds like you 're a student actually smile
I am sure everything will be fine , you have been so well looked after .
LMAO I was just typing al months t exactly the same thing . I knew someone that happened to , though ! Surprise boy !
Not posting until I know she is here safe and sound ... got a thing about jinxing stuff . Hope you understand smile
No she is definitely an Iona ... you deserve a wee princess in your life smile Will send it with other stuff ...
I think it would be better if the tweeted its news items as they come up , not in big batches .
You bloody love those railway questionnaires do n't you ? Teehee grin
would you like this ? Kids begged me for it but hate it now ...
Looks your pre-launch wi-fi testing theory was correect :
Tell him I LOL 'd
I 'm bipolar , so something I love when I start out , I hate when the swing goes the other way ! -LRB- reading and writing -RRB- !
Oh hehe sorry , I assumed writing grin
That 's why none of my books ever get finished . Hate every character after about 30k words grin
Glad your experience is positive but I would never , ever give 3 another penny , so bad was my experience .
Oh one of my Facebook friends has his heckles up over this -LRB- Dare I tell him I think you 're funny ? -RRB-
Not in the south of Ireland they are not .
I will join you in that , had loads of problems with BT over various things down the years . Had to ask our MP to sort it once .
Waddle off then my lovely . Do n't let Iona out until after Pete has been paid please . Can afford postage then grin
Going to give them a scrub ... not sure where to put them yet . Bedside tables maybe , if there is enough room for them -LRB- doubtful -RRB- .
They are thrifty like us Scots ... waste not want not and all that .
Dutch people are absolutely fantastic so I am sure that is how it works here too . I 've seen sofas etc left out before that go .
rrwell been eyeing them up all morning . When I saw the kiddie kitchen had gone I thought feckit I 'm taking those then !
What do you think of me two free chests ? Hope taking stuff off the street is OK here . It was considered theft in Ireland grin
The 3 mobiles were the only contact they had for us . Since we 'd moved house twice since taking the contracts on hehe .
Oh being dead does n't get you out of a contract LMAO . Arsewipes ! Pete and I canceled DDs and switched phones off . Byebye 3 .
Hahahahaha - I bet Steve was having a good chuckle when you did that !
3 ignored that where I lived in Ireland tripled in population in the hols . No increase in mast capacity 2 match .
I did n't know that Karen that is bloody awful . If I had known I would NEVER have given them my custom . That is disgusting !
AND I 've cleaned the house to within an inch of its life while riding the crest of this `` up '' '
So quite a good day , on a euphoric energy buzz , found a tenner under the sofa and now two free items of furniture ! Good score !
Wrong . New Years in Edinburgh is full of tourists these days . Not a local junkie in sight .
Someone put these out on the street for disposal . Too good to chuck .
Scored two really nice wicker chests . Someone else took the toddler kitchen that was there , too , so I figured it 's OK to help myself !
In Edinburgh , folks leave unwanted furniture etc on the pavement for anyone who fancies it to take away . Hope it 's the same here ...
I had to do the Twitter\/Blog attack on VF in Ireland , too. , but that was over home phone\/internet services .
Well now I am frankly disbelieving . I had no end of hell with them in Ireland . Ended up bumping them . Awful service .
Ah well just wait until you DO have a problem and get some chap in Calcutta tell you there 's nothing wrong with their signal !
Ca n't believe anyone would use `` 3 '' and `` decent signal '' in the same breath . At least you did n't say `` decent customer service . ''
BON USA - moved the sofa to sweep underneath and found a 10 note !
Aztec Camera on - singing along loud ...
I wonder if that is the REAL Barry Manilow who made a donation
So ... I 've run out of my tablets and feeling very hyper . Will try to stay off Twitter to avoid making a c \* nt of myself .
grand kids is a good enough justification I think .
you need a bean bag path to the kitchen
hahaha my kids play that all the time .
I can only draw trees hehe
good on you , thank you for standing up for all mental health sufferers . Be strong , be you . X
I 'm glad you made the point about O'Gorman . I find what he has done massively hypocritical , considering his situation .
Dammit - I am rubbish at arty stuff like this ... and not a UK resident . Oh well , maybe can enter ?
And now he 's leaving you feathers on the dog 's nose so that youknow he has n't forgotten smile Drink up , enjoy the good memories ... anger
Never too early on your anniversary . What would John be saying ?
THAT is so true .

Cunning ploy to stop you live-tweeting delays ?
Thunderbolts and lightening , very , very frightening ... well not so scared but soaked through 3 layers of clothing in 5 min walk to school !
I 'm certain I 've seen that said before about Kelman but ca n't recall if attributed to yourself .
I always think Stefano is Vic Reeves ' double
So great to hear you 're going to be ok . Rest up , be a good patient and get better soon .
Rubens Barrichello ?
Bollocks , what a nightmare angry Raging for you .
You just wasted a mouthful of beer with that ...
I would n't like to get something in my eye with a contact lens in at that speed . I 'd opt for specs I think .
She was gone before I had a chance to educate her . Shooting arrows at herself in the garden -LRB- bow wrong way round -RRB- .
My youngest says the cars at are `` not real racing cars . '' Overexposed to F1 , I fear .
Tell your lad his interesting statistic made my elder daughter go `` OMG '' . grin

Exactly how I feel about
I 'm ignoring chores smile It 's lovely to have a `` good cup '' for special use . I always manage to break mine though !
Smallest child learned a new Dutch word this week . `` Snoepje '' . Gave her the excuse to keep asking for more sweets !
Oooh nice ... hot tea and bone china were made for each other . I only have cheapo Ikea mugs inamused Watching ?
Oooh nice ... hot tea and bone china were made for each other . I only have cheapo Ikea mugs inamused Watching ?
Supporting and in today . Trying to send some of this Dutch sun south to you !
I know inamused I think it was 1977 or something so how the hell I remember it I do n't know
It was pre-Intercity high speed ... I can remember us all gathering in the fields for the first IC125 to pass by .

Used to play on those tracks in the pre electric days smile
On the train ? You 'll pass right through my family 's farm at Ayton .

Now my web sites are working again I am left with the same old problem . WTF will I write about !
Also better warn that `` getting blootered '' can mean to get hopelessly drunk ... or his next Edinburgh Festival could be interesting !
I thought a `` blooter '' was the same as a `` pagger '' ? A right good kicking -LRB- with any part of the foot -RRB- .
Like when my kids used to watch the Mickey Mouse Funhouse on TV and run about singing `` shake shake shake your penis . ''
I mean `` peanut cheese '' is just a mis-hearing away from penis cheese is n't it ?
BTW pindakaas translates as `` Peanut Cheese . '' Personally , I think peanut butter is a more appealing name for it .
Aaah seems to be a Rankers fan ... that explains the sense of humor failure anyway .
Does it amuse you that people who do n't like you\/your humor still bother their arses to follow you ?
Today I have eaten a Snickers , a Twix and three slices of toast with pindakaas - think I caught `` eating for two '' from
Every time udpdates I think they ca n't do any better ... but they still do ! Loving 3.4 so far . Shame it distracts me from writing !
And by coincidence they all go back up within a few second onds of last ticket update . Hate liars .
Now they are saying it is DNS propagation - but ca n't be as they were all fine up to this am . Prop had been done !

Aah well impossible to get a mortgage OR a job these days ... times have changed .
I do n't know ... does that day ever come ?

First little sign of puberty in my elder daughter ... she is only 8 . Do n't want her to start using de-odour chems this young angry
Good plan ! Though I suspect my loud TV at the weekend probably annoys them already grin
Neighbours are having a football party , TV out in the garden and air horns ! Going to be an interesting night sleep-wise .

Ah now this is where things go wrong . Is what I remember actually what I did last night ... or the one before .
Yep checked all pockets , even checked the kids ' , vigorously shaken washing basket and no jingly sounds ...

Partisan sending off already ... realizing rapidly why I CBA with soccer ,
I dare you to somehow work that into your next book !
It 's a mark of how popular is that `` the real '' CW has to be designated as such , even by the F1 press .
I somehow seem to have some opening ceremony on . Is it that football thing ? Must have cost a fortune in colored t-shirts .
